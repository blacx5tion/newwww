    <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic,
        weakly typed, prototype-base, multi-paradigm, and interpreted
        programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one
        of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
        It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs,
        including video games. The majority of websites emply it, and all
        modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means
        of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines
        represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the
        ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec
        fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond
        ECMA.
